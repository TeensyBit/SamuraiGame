# Introduction

I am a budding embedded systems developer with a profound passion for low-level hardware. My expertise lies in bare-metal embedded driver development, where I thrive on the intricacies of hardware interaction and optimization.

While I initially dabbled in web development, I found it to be too monotonous for my liking. However, my interest in software development was reignited when I embarked on a Full Stack Development (FSD) course. The course presented a diverse array of subjects, one of which was particularly captivating: JavaScript.

When tasked with creating a project for the course, I initially contemplated the ubiquitous choice of developing a portfolio website. However, as I delved deeper, I found the process of designing and fine-tuning the layout to be tedious and cumbersome. Seeking a more intellectually stimulating challenge, I pivoted towards game development.

Venturing into the realm of game development was a novel and exciting endeavor for me. JavaScript, with its versatility and accessibility, seemed like the perfect tool to bring my vision to life. Inspired by the samurai ethos of discipline and skill, I embarked on the journey of replicating a JavaScript-based samurai fighting game. This project not only provides a creative outlet but also serves as a platform to apply my programming skills in a logical and engaging context.
